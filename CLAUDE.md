# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository overview

Personal dotfiles for a Linux/WSL2 environment. The Neovim config is the most structured part; shell configs and scripts live at the repo root and in `bin/`.

The dotfiles are deployed by symlinking into the home directory. `~/.config/nvim/` corresponds to `nvim/` in this repo (e.g. `~/.config/nvim/toml/` → `dotfiles/nvim/toml/`).

## Neovim configuration architecture

The plugin stack is built on two layers:

- **denops.vim** — Deno runtime bridge that allows TypeScript/JavaScript plugin code to run inside Neovim.
- **dpp.vim** — "dark powered" plugin manager that uses denops to run `config.ts` at startup.

### Bootstrap flow

1. `nvim/init.lua` requires `option/option` (editor options) then `darkpowerd/dpp`.
2. `lua/darkpowerd/dpp.lua` bootstraps: auto-clones `dpp.vim` and `denops.vim` into `~/.cache/nvim/dpp/` if absent, adds them to runtimepath, then loads the cached plugin state from `~/.cache/nvim/dpp/`.
3. On first run (or after `:DppMakeState`), `config.ts` is invoked via denops. It reads `toml/dein.toml` (eager plugins) and `toml/dein_lazy.toml` (lazy-loaded by filetype), plus any plugins found under `~/work/` (local development).
4. The generated state is persisted to disk; subsequent startups load it directly without re-running TypeScript.

### Key plugin management commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `:DppInstall` | Install all plugins listed in the TOML files |
| `:DppUpdate [name ...]` | Update all plugins (or named ones) |
| `:DppMakeState` | Regenerate the plugin state cache after changing TOML files |

### Adding or removing plugins

Edit `nvim/toml/dein.toml` (load on startup) or `nvim/toml/dein_lazy.toml` (load on filetype). After saving, run `:DppMakeState` inside Neovim, then `:DppInstall` if adding new repos.

### Lua module layout

```
nvim/lua/
  darkpowerd/   dpp.lua (bootstrap), ddu.lua (fuzzy finder config)
  option/       option.lua (editor settings), cmd.lua, colorscheme.lua, cd.lua, tabstop.lua
  keymap/       keymap.lua (leader mappings), yankround.lua
  plugins/      lspconfig.lua, formatter.lua, nvim-tree.lua, autocmd.lua, image_preview.lua
```

Most `lua/plugins/` files are currently commented out in `init.lua`; enable them by uncommenting the relevant `require()` lines.

### Fuzzy finder (ddu.vim)

`lua/darkpowerd/ddu.lua` configures the ddu fuzzy finder (currently commented out in `init.lua`). Leader mappings use `,u` as a prefix: `,uc` for file\_rec, `,ub` for buffers, `,um` for MRU, etc.

### LSP

`lua/plugins/lspconfig.lua` sets up mason.nvim + mason-lspconfig for automatic LSP server installation. Currently enables `lua_ls` and `vimls`.

## Shell / bin scripts

Scripts in `bin/` are standalone shell utilities (QEMU/TPM setup, buildroot helpers, SSH shortcuts, etc.). No build step required.
